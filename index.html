      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>My name is Jackie Dallas, I’m a retired SSgt. from the United States Air Force. During my 8 year tenure I served as a Radar Technician accumulating unprecedented experience working with high voltage electrical equipment. I became proficient
        at troubleshooting, isolating electrical malfunctions, reading schematics, component level soldering, signal processing, and using all types of test equipment. I also obtained my Associate's Degree from the Community College of the Air Force
        in Electronics Systems Technology in 2019. I attended Airman Leadership School and became a frontline supervisor, further diversifying my abilities to not only do hands on maintenance, but also to lead and train others. I received two
        achievement medals from deployments, and also a commendation medal from one of my former squadrons.<br>

        I’m now a full-time student at Codeup Academy, studying to be a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>I consider myself to be an above average computer programmer at this point in my early career. I'm in the middle of a six month accelerated full stack web development bootcamp and I've become very fond of the front-end side of programming. I'm very good at CSS and JavaScript. </p>

        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p class="comm-info">My communication skills are second to none. I served 8 years in the United States Air Force in a Air Control Squadron. I maintained and operated several radar systems, giving pilots and air traffic controllers optimum airspace coverage. My job forced me to become a masterful communicator, not only to our clients, but also to various high ranking officers who wanted to understand our equipment. I became very proficient at explaining very complicated theories and processes in simple terms. I think this skill is one of my best skills because great communication is needed no matter what field you work in.</p>
